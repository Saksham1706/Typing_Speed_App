A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Caught between a rock and a hard place.
Closing the barn door after the horse escapes.
Do I look like a turnip that just fell off the turnip truck?
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.
Friends are flowers in the garden of life.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Just staying one day ahead of yesterday.
Lie down with dogs and wake up with fleas.
The sharper the berry, the sweeter the wine.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
The stronger the breeze the stronger the trees.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
A weed is no more than a flower in disguise.
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
All work and no play robs one of some fun in life.
Your car is out of date as soon as it is paid for.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Actions speak louder than words.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Better late than never.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Look before you leap.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
All that glitters is not gold.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
A watched pot never boils.
Curiosity killed the cat.
The early bird catches the worm.
Time and tide wait for no man.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
There's no use crying over spilled milk.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
You reap what you sow.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
It takes two to tango.
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Jack of all trades, master of none.
Practice makes perfect.
Old habits die hard.
Silence is golden.
No pain, no gain.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Two heads are better than one.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
He who hesitates is lost.
Haste makes waste.
Honesty is the best policy.
Laughter is the best medicine.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
There's no place like home.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
You win some, you lose some.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
Let the cat out of the bag.
Burning the midnight oil.
Jumping on the bandwagon.
A leopard can't change its spots.
There's a method to the madness.
Hit the nail on the head.
Don't beat a dead horse.
It's the tip of the iceberg.
Throwing caution to the wind.
Bite off more than you can chew.
Stealing someone's thunder.
Caught red-handed.
Get a taste of your own medicine.
The ball is in your court.
Pulling your leg.
On thin ice.
Break the ice.
The last straw.
Off the beaten path.
Take it with a grain of salt.
Burning bridges.
The elephant in the room.
Let bygones be bygones.
Don't cry wolf.
Water under the bridge.
The pot calling the kettle black.
Hit the road.
Grasping at straws.
Back to the drawing board.
