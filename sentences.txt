The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
Crazy Fredrick bought many very exquisite opal jewels.
We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize.
A wizard's job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.
The jay, pig, fox, zebra and my wolves quack!
